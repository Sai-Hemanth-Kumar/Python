## Python Learning Codes

This repository contains the codes I wrote while learning Python and common data structures/algorithms.

### What's inside
- **Codes**: Practice programs and DSA implementations
  - `Codes/DSA/Stack`, `Queue`, `LL/SLL`, `Graph`
  - `Codes/Patterns`: Console pattern programs (Cross, Diamond, Plus)
  - `Codes/Normal`: Small, general Python scripts
- **Web_Development/Flask**: Simple Flask examples with templates and static files
- **Materials**: Reference PDFs and notes
- **Anna-Requirement.txt**: Optional dependencies list

### Quick start
1. Clone or open the folder.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies if needed:
   - Windows PowerShell:
     ```bash
     pip install -r Anna-Requirement.txt
     ```
4. Run any script directly, for example:
   - Data structures:
     ```bash
     python Codes/DSA/Stack/Stack1.py
     python Codes/DSA/Queue/Queue1.py
     python Codes/DSA/LL/SLL/SLL1.py
     ```
   - Patterns:
     ```bash
     python Codes/Patterns/Cross/Cross1.py
     python Codes/Patterns/Diamond/Number_Diamond_Pattern/Diamond.py
     ```
   - Flask demos (from `Web_Development/Flask`):
     ```bash
     python Web_Development/Flask/File1.py
     ```

### Notes
- Scripts are mostly standalone; run them individually.
- Folder names indicate the topic to help you browse quickly.
